# Q-Learning-Based-Power-Control-Algorithm-for-D2D-Communication
Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is a promising technology of 5G cellular networks. 

D2D communication aims at establishing a direct communication link between the user equipments, located in the close proximity of each other, instead of traversing through the core network.

D2D communications can be in-band and out-band. Furthermore, it can be underlay and overlay in in-band whereas controlled and autonomous in out-band.
